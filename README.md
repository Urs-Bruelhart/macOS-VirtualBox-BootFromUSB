# macOS-VirtualBox-BootFromUSB
macOS bash script - This script will let you boot from a USB stick in a VM of your VirtualBox

This script assumes that you have already created a a VM in VirtualBox. You do not have to attach this VM a Hard Disk, the script will automatically attach it for you.

I wrote this script because I found it really annoying to everytime struggle get the right vmdk and change the owner of the /dev/disk#

Make sure to edit the variables before launching the script.

So far I have only tested it only on Mac.
